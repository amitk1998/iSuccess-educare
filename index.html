         <p class="text-small">The concept of STEAM education has emerged from what was previously known as STEM education. The acronym itself stands for science, technology, engineering, the arts, and mathematics. These subjects have been grouped together to emphasize their importance for the global workforce, to boost student engagement, to highlight the transferable skills they teach, and to encourage integration.
          Read on to learn more about STEAM education, what it is, how it works within the classroom, and the importance of each of the individual components that make up the acronym, or visit our education solutions page for further insights into the modern classroom.

      <p class="psubsection text-small">
        With the powerful trend toward digital everywhere, educators will be increasingly challenged to find new and compelling ways to engage learners. Students will continue to be both intrigued and distracted by new technologies and overwhelmed by avalanches of information.

        The key will be to help teachers figure out how to use the right technologies at the right time to do the right job for students. This will require teachers to know how to help students sort through data and information to learn what they need to know to secure their future paths. Educators will be able to build bridges between what the workforce needs, and how to effectively prepare students for the future, and for jobs that may not exist today

        From the days of the clay tablet and the abacus, technology has been a mainstay in supporting teaching and learning. In recent years, with the advent of powerful handheld computers and ubiquitous communications, the rightful role of technology in the classroom has reached a critical juncture: the lofty promises have not always been matched by results. Amid the flurry of “next big things” and “latest technologies,” it seems education may have lost sight of two very important factors—the student and the teacher.
        “We, as educators, have spent the last 25 years worried most about whether teachers are using technology in the classroom and not enough about how they are using it,” says Wendy Drexler, an assistant professor of educational technology at the Johns Hopkins School of Education.

        One key factor to make this a reality is to enable students to think critically and creatively  to encourage them to demonstrate persistence in solving some of the most difficult challenges we face as a global society. Providing students with real-world obstacles to push through and solve gives them the ability to engage, evaluate data, consider solutions, and forge an entrepreneurial path forward.
        The key will be to help teachers figure out how to use the right technologies at the right time to do the right job for students. This will require teachers to know how to help students sort through data and information to learn what they need to know to secure their future paths.
