          <p class="text-big">About us</p>
          <p class="text-small">Hi there. We are iSuccess-educare by Vista, the global creative platform that makes it easy for clients and freelance designers to work together online. Since 2022, our freelance community has brought more than one million creative projects to life for thousands of genius entrepreneurs, savvy small business owners, and brands with big ideas.
            As part of the Vista family, we are dedicated to helping small businesses thrive through expert design.
          </p>
          <p class="text-big">Things to know about us</p>
          <p class="text-small">We believe in putting people first
            People are the heart of 99designs. Our mission is to champion creativity and create opportunities for people all over the world - wherever they are and however they want to work.
          </p>
          <p class="text-small">We believe in people helping people create their own success
            Our design community has a ton of talent and professional experience. Our clients are smart, passionate and full of great ideas. And the 99designs team has spent more than a decade building a world-class platform to enable remote creative collaboration. It's all of these people working together that makes the magic happen.
          </p>
          <p class="text-small">We believe that design has no borders
            Having offices and colleagues all around the world is a pretty sweet deal, but we think it's even more amazing that any designer—from Sydney to Serbia—can earn a living doing what they love on our platform. In fact, our creator community has earned more than $300m on 99designs so far.

          </p>
          <p class="text-small">We believe the journey should be fun
            We like to take the scenic route, crank up 99 Luftballons'by Nena and enjoy the ride. While we believe in the serious power of great design, creativity and play go hand in hand: the journey should always feel like a great road trip.
